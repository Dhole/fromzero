# fromzero

This is a personal project that consists of building a computer software stack
from zero, for learning purposes.  This will be a Work in Progress for a while.

The target hardware is an stm32 microcontroller.

There are several steps I have in mind for this project, but the ultimate goal
is to be able to have a simple operating system that can run apps and can be
used to program its own apps.  All the code will written from scratch and in a
simple enough way that a single person can undestand the entire stack.

The first step will be writting a Thumb (ARM 16 bit instructions architecture)
assembler in C.

Future steps include:
- Implementing a compiler / interpreter of a higher level language (like Forth)
- Rewriting the assembler in a language that can be compiled / interpreted from the "computer"
- Writing a basic operating system
