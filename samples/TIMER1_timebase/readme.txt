  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the 
TIMER peripheral in timing mode with the corresponding interrupt request for channel 0 
in order to generate a time base.

  The TIMxCLK frequency is set to systemcoreclock, the prescaler is 5400, so the TIMER1 
counter clock is 20KHz.

  TIMER1 configuration is timing mode, and the timing is 0.2s(4000/20000 = 0.2s), and 
the CH0 update rate = TIMER1 counter clock/CH0CV = 20000/4000 = 5Hz. 

  Enable the channel 0 interrupt, so the TIMER1 generates an interrupt each 0.2s, in 
the handler routine, LED1 is toggled each 0.2s.
